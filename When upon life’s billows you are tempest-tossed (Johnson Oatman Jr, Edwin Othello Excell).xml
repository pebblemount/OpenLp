    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When upon life’s billows you are tempest-tossed,<br/>When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,<br/>Count your many blessings, name them one by one,<br/>And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br/>Count your blessings, see what God has done!<br/>Count your blessings, name them one by one,<br/>*Count your many blessings, see what God has done.<br/>[*And it will surprise you what the Lord has done.]</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Are you ever burdened with a load of care?<br/>Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?<br/>Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,<br/>And you will keep singing as the days go by.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>When you look at others with their lands and gold,<br/>Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.<br/>Count your many blessings, money cannot buy<br/>Your reward in heaven, nor your Lord on high.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>So, amid the conflict whether great or small,<br/>Do not be discouraged, God is over all;<br/>Count your many blessings, angels will attend,<br/>Help and comfort give you to your journey’s end.</lines>
    </verse>
