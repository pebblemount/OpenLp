    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>I've heard a thousand stories <br/>Of what they think You're like <br/>But I've heard the tender whisper <br/>Of love in the dead of night <br/>And You tell me that You're pleased <br/>And that I'm never a lone </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>You're a good, good Father<br/>It's who You are, it's who You are<br/>It's who You are <br/>And I'm loved by You <br/>It's who I am, it's who I am <br/>It's who I am </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Oh and I've seen many searching for <br/>Answers far and wide <br/>But I know we're all searching for answers only You provide <br/>Because You know just what we need <br/>Before we say a word</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>Oh this Love so undeniable<br/>I, I can hardly speak Peace so unexplainable<br/>I, I can hardly think <br/>As You call me, deeper still <br/>As You call me deeper still <br/>As You call me deeper still<br/>Into love, love, love</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c2">
      <lines>You're a good, good Father<br/>It's who You are, it's who You are<br/>It's who You are <br/>And I'm loved by You <br/>It's who I am, it's who I am <br/>It's who I am </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="e1">
      <lines>You are perfect in all of Your ways <br/>You are perfect in all of Your ways  </lines>
