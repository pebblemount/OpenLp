    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>In Christ alone my hope is found,<br/>He is my light, my strength, my song;<br/>This Cornerstone, this solid Ground,<br/>Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br/>What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br/>When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br/>My Comforter, my All in All,<br/>Here in the love of Christ I stand.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>In Christ alone! – who took on flesh,<br/>Fullness of God in helpless babe.<br/>This gift of love and righteousness,<br/>Scorned by the ones He came to save:<br/>Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br/>The wrath of God was satisfied –<br/>For every sin on Him was laid;<br/>Here in the death of Christ I live.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There in the ground His body lay,<br/>Light of the world by darkness slain:<br/>Then bursting forth in glorious day<br/>Up from the grave He rose again!<br/>And as He stands in victory<br/>Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me,<br/>For I am His and He is mine –<br/>Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v4">
      <lines>No guilt in life, no fear in death,<br/>This is the power of Christ in me;<br/>From life’s first cry to final breath,<br/>Jesus commands my destiny.<br/>No power of hell, no scheme of man,<br/>Can ever pluck me from His hand:<br/>Till He returns or calls me home,<br/>Here in the power of Christ I’ll stand.</lines>
