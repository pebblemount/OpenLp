    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>All is calm and all is bright<br/>Everywhere but in your heart tonight<br/>They’re singing carols of joy and peace<br/>But you feel too far gone and too far out of reach</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Somewhere in your silent night<br/>Heaven hears the song your broken heart has cried<br/>Hope is here, just lift your head<br/>For love has come to find you<br/>Somewhere in your silent night</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>From heaven’s height to manger low<br/>There is no distance the Prince of Peace won’t go<br/>From manger low to Calvary’s hill<br/>When your pain runs deep, His love runs deeper still<br/>He has always loved you, child<br/>And He always will</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Lift your head, Lift your heart<br/>Emmanuel will meet you where you are<br/>He knows your hurt, He knows your name<br/>And you’re the very reason that He came</lines>
    </verse>
