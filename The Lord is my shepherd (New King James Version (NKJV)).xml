    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>The Lord is my shepherd;<br/>I shall not want.<br/>He makes me to lie down in green pastures;<br/>He leads me beside the still waters.<br/>He restores my soul;<br/>He leads me in the paths of righteousness<br/>For His name’s sake.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,<br/>I will fear no evil;<br/>For You are with me;<br/>Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies;<br/>You anoint my head with oil;<br/>My cup runs over.<br/>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me<br/>All the days of my life;<br/>And I will dwell in the house of the Lord<br/>Forever.</lines>
    </verse>
