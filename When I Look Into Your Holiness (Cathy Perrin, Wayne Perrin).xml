    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When I look into Your holiness<br/>When I gaze into Your loveliness<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of You<br/>When I've found the joy of reaching Your heart<br/>When my will becomes enthralled in Your love<br/>When all things that surround<br/>Become shadows in the light of You</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>I worship You, I worship You<br/>The reason I live is to worship You<br/>I worship You, I worship You<br/>The reason I live is to worship You</lines>
