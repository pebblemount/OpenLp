    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>Come out of sadness from wherever you've been<br/>Come, broken hearted let rescue begin<br/>Come find your mercy, O sinner, come kneel <br/>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal <br/>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Lay down your burdens<br/>Lay down your shame <br/>All who are broken <br/>Lift up your face <br/>O wanderer, come home <br/>You're not too far <br/>So lay down your hurt, lay down your heart <br/>Come as you are </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>There's hope for the hopeless <br/>And all those who've strayed <br/>Come sit at the table <br/>Come taste the grace <br/>There's rest for the weary <br/>Rest that endures<br/>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't cure </lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="b1">
      <lines>Come as you are <br/>Come as you are <br/>Fall in His arms <br/>Come as you are</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v3">
      <lines>There's joy for the morning <br/>O sinner, be still <br/>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal <br/>Earth has no sorrow that Heaven can't heal</lines>
