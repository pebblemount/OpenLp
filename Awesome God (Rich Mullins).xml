    <verse name="v1">
      <lines>When He rolls up His sleeves<br/>He ain't just putting on the ritz<br/>(Our God is an awesome God)<br/>There's thunder in His footsteps<br/>And lightning in His fists<br/>(Our God is an awesome God)<br/>And the Lord wasn't joking<br/>When He kicked 'em out of Eden<br/>It wasn't for no reason<br/>That He shed His blood<br/>His return is very close<br/>And so you better be believing that<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="c1">
      <lines>Our God is an awesome God<br/>He reigns from heaven above<br/>With wisdom, power, and love<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
    </verse>
    <verse name="v2">
      <lines>And when the sky was starless<br/>In the void of the night<br/>(Our God is an awesome God)<br/>He spoke into the darkness<br/>And created the light<br/>(Our God is an awesome God)<br/>Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom<br/>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross<br/>I hope that we have not<br/>Too quickly forgotten that<br/>Our God is an awesome God</lines>
